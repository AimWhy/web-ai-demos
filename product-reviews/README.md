## Get started
* [Only once, or when new env variables are added] Set up environment variables:
  * Create an `.env.development.local` file that follows the structure documented in `.env.template`.
  * Fill in the values in `.env.development.local`. No quotes are needed. Googlers: Ask your teammates for the `VITE_GEMMA_MODEL_PATH` value we use.
* [Only once, or when dependencies are updated] Run `npm install`.
* Run `npm run dev`. The project is running!

## Build for deployment
* [Only once, or when new env variables are added]:
  * Create an `.env.production.local` file that follows the structure documented in `.env.template`.
  * Fill in the values in `.env.production.local`. No quotes are needed. Googlers: Ask your teammates for the `VITE_GEMMA_MODEL_PATH` value we use. 
* Run `npm run build`, then run `npm run preview` and check that your changes don't include a regression.

## About vite env variables
* ðŸš¨ Important: `local` in the env file name ensures that the env file is gitignored.
* If you introduce new env variables other developers will need, make sure to include them in `.env.template` in your PR. To prevent accidentally leaking env variables to the client, only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to your Vite-processed code.
